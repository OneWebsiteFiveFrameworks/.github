# One Website, Five Frameworks

A project by Bryan Zou. The idea is to try five different popular front-end web design frameworks to understand the positives and negatives of each, while simultaneously finding one that suits myself.

## Frameworks used

- React with Tanstack Router
- Vue.js
- Next.js
- Angular
- Svelte
